# Welcome to the frontend of our MERN application! 👋

This project was built with ReactJS and serves as the user interface for our full-stack web application. Our application allows users to create an account and login securely, with password encryption using bcrypt and JWT tokens. We have also integrated session and cookies functionalities to ensure a seamless user experience.
